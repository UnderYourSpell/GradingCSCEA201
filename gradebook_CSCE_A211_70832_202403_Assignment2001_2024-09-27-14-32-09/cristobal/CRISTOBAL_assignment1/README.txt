ASSIGNMENT 1

1.  To run the program, using your chosen terminal, under the cristobal_problem_1 directory, 
    enter the following:
    - g++ -o 1 1.cpp
    - ./1 < enrollments.txt

2.  Run the program as usual. The user (gambler) will be given $100 for the game. The gambler 
    is then asked to enter a wager equal or under $100. They will then be asked to enter a 
    number between 1 & 6, this will then run 3 dice rolls. Base on what is generated randomly,
    matches will or will not be found for the gambler. The game continues until your wager
    reaches zero or 3 matches have been found. The user is then prompted at the end of
    each roll, 'y' or 'n' , to determine whether the user would like to play again or not. 
    If yes, the game continues; if no, the game ends and the remaining amount of money is
    outputed.

4.  The program contains two test codes within already given values for change. The program will then 
    output the most logical change given based on the change values chosen. The user will now be prompted 
    to enter specific change. Similar to the test code, the program will output how many of each coin is 
    needed to add up to the amount of change.
