Problem 2
	command (Windows):
		C:\Users\tonyh\source\repos\Hillman_problem_2\x64\Debug>Hillman_problem_2.exe
	Known issues:   I initially decided to use doubles for wagers and cash balance. The program assumes that
			users won't try to input fractions of cents and there could be minor accuracy
			issues when dealing with small decimal values. The assignment does not specify what data
			types should be used and it seemed that my problem described above was outside the scope
			of this assignment so I left it as is. (The program does correctly handle cases where the user is 
			out of cash or tries to bet more than have.)

Problem 3
	No real program
	I was unsure what kind of file this program should be so I just left it as .cpp
	My answers are written as comments on the .cpp file and algorithms are expressed as pseudocode


Problem 4
	command (Windows):
		C:\Users\tonyh\source\repos\Hillman_problem_4\x64\Debug>Hillman_problem_4.exe
	Known issues: NONE
