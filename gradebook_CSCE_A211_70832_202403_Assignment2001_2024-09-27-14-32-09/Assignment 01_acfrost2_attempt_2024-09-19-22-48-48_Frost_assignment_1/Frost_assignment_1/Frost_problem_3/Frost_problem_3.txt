1) If the moving object turns right every time the way forward is blocked by a wall. Otherwise it will move forward. It should not follow repeat paths that solely lead to dead ends. Using this method, it will eventually find its way through the maze. It can avoid going in circles because it sticks to the side of a wall and will not continue down the same paths that have led to dead ends.
2) A computer program could generate a maze by generating many open passages that are disconnected, and then it would go through and reconnect all the passages randomly so that there are dead ends and a clear way to the end point. This also allows for more randomness, though it may decrease the difficulty of the maze. I think that a good maze requires dead ends and unpredictability to challenge the player, which my algorithm finds.
