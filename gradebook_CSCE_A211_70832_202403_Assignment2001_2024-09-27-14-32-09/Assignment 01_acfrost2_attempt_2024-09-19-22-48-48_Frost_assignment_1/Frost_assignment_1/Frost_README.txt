For problem 1, you have to use the command prompt and enter a command to put the enrollments.txt file into the console of Frost_problem_1.cpp. 
For problem 2, please follow the instructions in the console. There aren't any grievous consequences if you don't, but the house will get mad at you!!!
For problem 4, you have to run the program. Because test code is used, there is no need for the user to input anything.
