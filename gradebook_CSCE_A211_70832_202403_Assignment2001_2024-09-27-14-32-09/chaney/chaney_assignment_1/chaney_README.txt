Problem 3 Maze Generation Question

1. 
I would make it so that at every turn it will turn left if there's an open space.
If the bot turns 4 times it would then force itself to move forward
If the bot cant turn left it will go straight

2. 
I'd first make a grid of the wanted size and just have it be filled with X
I would then choose a random position as the start position and make that an open spot
I would also pick a random spot either on the edges or somewhere in the maze depending on the type of maze and make it the exit
Then I would randomly pick a cell next to the start and make it Open and continue this until it reaches the end.
I would then have the program go back and create branches off the main path and create alternate routes / dead ends
