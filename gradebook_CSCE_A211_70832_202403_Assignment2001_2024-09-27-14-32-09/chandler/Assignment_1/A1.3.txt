A) A basic algorithim would be to "keep your right hand on the wall" so to speak. You would accomplish this by having a series of options: 
1: If at exit, win
2: else if possible, turn and go right 
3: else if possible go straight 
4: else if possible turn and go left
5: else turn around


B) Some important criteria are:

No closed off sections
Is solvable
Has an exit on a non self contained wall

The algorithm uses the wall itself to solve the maze, so it needs the walls to be connected to the exit.
