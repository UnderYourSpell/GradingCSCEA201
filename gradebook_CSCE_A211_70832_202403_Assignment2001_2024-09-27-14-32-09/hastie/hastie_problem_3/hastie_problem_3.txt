1.	Given a random start location, 
think of an algorithm that does not use recursion that would find its way to the exit S.
Your algorithm should be able to run on an arbitrary maze,
and not be specific to the sample given above.
Can your algorithm avoid going in circles? 
Describe your algorithm.

I could utilize a simple algorithm that follows the left wall until it finds the exit.

2.	Think of a way to have a computer program generate a random maze.
What are important criteria that a good maze should have?
Describe how your algorithm could possibly meet the criteria.

One important piece of criteria that really defines a maze is a start point and a finish,
where both points are connected by a left wall and a right wall.
so my algorithm would simply generate a start on one side and the finish on oposite or adjacent sides of a square area,
then i would have a left and right wall connect to those points.
