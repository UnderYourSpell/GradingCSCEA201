Problem 1.) 

Write a C++ program that reads 3295 numbers from the console (i.e., you would normally type in the numbers) and outputs how many of those numbers start with 1, how many start with 2, etc. up to 9.

Problem 2.) 
Write a program that implements a C++ version of Chuck-a-luck.

Dice Rolling: The dice are rolled using the rand() function, which produces a random value between 1 and 6 for each die.
Counting Matches: The program tracks how many times the player's selected number shows up on the rolled dice.
Game Progression: The game continues in a loop as long as the player has sufficient funds and decides to keep playing.


Problem 4.) 

Write a program that reads an integer from 1-99 that represents some amount of change to dispense. 


calculateChange Function:
This function takes the amount of change and calculates how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are needed. The number of each coin is passed by reference, so the function can directly update the values.

Main Function:
The main function asks the user for a number between 1 and 99. It then uses the calculateChange function to find out how many of each coin is needed and displays the result for two test cases. The program also checks that the user enters a valid number.
