Problem 1.
I was working on this when the linux server was down so I used the command prompt to navigated to where it is stored on my system and used this command.
Carman_problem_1.exe < enrollments.txt

Problem 2.
I complied this in visual studio and I have made prompts to direct the user while running.

Known issue: can't handle Non-integer inputs for wagers and roll guess.

Problem 4.
Complied in visual studio. No user inputs, so it just outputs the two test lines.
